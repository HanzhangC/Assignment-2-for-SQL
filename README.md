In this code, I’m working on an SQL database for a startup called "newQuora," which is an online question-and-answer forum. The system has two types of users: general users and admins, and it manages features like forums, posts, comments, followers, friends, and upvotes.

I need to complete 10 SQL tasks, where I write queries to solve specific problems. Some tasks include listing forums with subscriptions, finding the forum with the most recent post, identifying high-quality contributors, and managing relationships between users. For each task, I’ll write a single SQL query without using views or common table expressions.

To ensure my queries run correctly, I’ll test them in MySQL Workbench, making sure the "FULL_GROUP_BY" mode is enabled. Once my queries are working, I’ll submit an SQL script with my answers before the deadline on Canvas.
